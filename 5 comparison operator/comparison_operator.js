a=5;
b="5";
console.log(a==b);// this will givve true in the console screen because the == operator 
// check the value only so the value are same that's why it is true
console.log(a===b);// this will give the value false because the === operator see the 
// value and as well as the type here the value is same but the datatye is not he same
// that's why it will give us false
console.log(2!=3);// it will give true b/c 2 not equal to 3
console.log(2!=='2');//it will give us true b/c it  value are same but its datatype is not same  and the condition is not equal so 2 and string 2 is not equal so  value will be true
console.log(10>2);
console.log(10>=20);
console.log(10<20);
console.log(30<=20);
// we can see the answers of the above in the console screen
